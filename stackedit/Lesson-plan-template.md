|Chris Huson |Lesson Plan 10th Grade Geometry  2 October 2018|
|---|---|
|**Guiding Question**|How do we practice our geometry skills?
|**Learning Standards**|HSG.CO.A.1 Know precise geometric definitions
|**Materials**|Laptop computer, Calculator plot; Overhead doc-cam|
|**Vocabulary**|Postulate, axiom, theorem, congruent, collinear, midpoint, empirical, relative frequency number, theoretical probability, sample space, event|

||Teacher Actions|Student Actions|
|---|---|---|
|**Do Now:** Given the geometric situation, draw and label a diagram. State the geometric equation representing the situation, substitute and solve the algebra, and check the solution. |Teacher poses problem, monitors individual progress and assists as appropriate. Teacher highlights key take-aways and connects to lesson.|Students work problem individually, comparing answers. Students present and discuss solutions.|
|**Procedure:** Applying geometry and algebraic formal methods.|Teacher assesses homework (completion basis, with spot-check of selected problems). Teacher presents lesson concepts: Discussion of lesson concepts. Format: “I do, we do, you do”. Teacher connects new practices to existing body of knowledge, assesses level of understanding.|Students present explanation of probabilistic situation, interpreting results. Students take notes, respond to questions and each other, ask questions. Students complete practice problems, share on board. Exercises 10A \#4 p 339|

|**Assessment**|Writing to learn: Use proper geometric and algebraic notation in the beginnings of a 2-column proof format|
|---|---|
|**Homework** Complete Deltamath online problems|Exercises to practice and review; Textbook problems. Complete exercises, working 30 to 60 minutes, using notes and internet access.|
|**Differentiation**|Open questioning: Are there more than one approach to the pbo? How do we methodically create the sample space of a situation? Why do “with replacement” and “without replacement” differ? Challenge homework problems|
|**Grouping** Group heterogeneously, seating chart.|Rapid exposure and independent homework: Class at regular pace: \*IEP, \*\*ELL|
