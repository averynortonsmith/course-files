\subsubsection*{Word Problem Wednesday}
  \item After the BECA ice skating trip, Dr. Huson took 11 students to get something to eat. Some get chicken fingers, which cost \$4 each, and the rest just get french fries, which cost \$2.50 each. The total cost was \$37.50. Dr. Huson got chicken. How many students got french fries? \\[0.5cm]
  Use $c$ for the number of chicken orders and $f$ for the number of french fry orders. Complete the table of costs below.
