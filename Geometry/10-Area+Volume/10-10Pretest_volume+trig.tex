\subsubsection*{10.10 Pretest: Volume, density, trig review}
 \begin{enumerate}

  \item Write an equation of the line that is parallel to the line whose equation is $2y=3x+4$ and passes through the point $(1,4)$.

  \item From a point on the ground one-half mile from the base of a historic monument, the angle of elevation to its top is $11.87^\circ$. To the nearest foot, what is the height of the monument?\\[1cm]

  \item The map of a campground is shown below. Campsite C, first aid station F, and supply station S lie along a straight path. The path from the supply station to the tower, T, is perpendicular to the path from the supply station to the campsite. The length of path FS is 400 feet. The angle formed by path TF and path FS is $72^\circ$. The angle formed by path   and path CS is $55^\circ$.\\[0.5cm]

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Determine and state the volume of concrete needed, \emph{in cubic feet}. \vspace{1cm}
      \item Sarah can mix her own concrete for \$3.25 per cubic foot. How much money will it cost her to replace the two concrete sections?
