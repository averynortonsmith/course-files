# course-files

This repository stores files for my high school mathematics courses. Three courses each have a directory (IB1, IB2, Geometry), which are then divided into unit folders.

Some higher-level presentations and course plans are composed in markdown on StackEdit and backed up in the stackedit directory here. They are also "published" to a Github Pages repo under https://chrishuson.github.io/. Other general presentations are also hosted directly in that repository.
